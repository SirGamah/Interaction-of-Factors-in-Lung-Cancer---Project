# ABSTRACT

Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Accurate prediction of survival is crucial for effective patient management, treatment planning, and resource allocation. Traditional prognostic factors, such as stage and histology, offer valuable insights, but they often fall short in providing the personalized information needed for precision medicine. The rapidly evolving field of precision prevention and medicine emphasizes tailoring interventions based on individual risk profiles, which importantly include genetic predispositions. This research investigates the application of various machine learning models to predict lung cancer survival. A key focus is identifying the factors most influential in these predictions, as they can inform precision prevention strategies and potentially highlight indicators of underlying genetic vulnerabilities impacting patient outcomes. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of clinical and lifestyle factors, we aim to develop predictive models capable of contributing to more targeted screening, earlier detection, and personalized treatment approaches. Ultimately, this work seeks to improve survival rates and advance the field of precision oncology.
